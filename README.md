# Apple Product Price Analysis (2022)
- Working with this dataset allowed me to practice cleaning data that had various issues with data types in the price column. This experience was valuable for improving my skills in data analysis and is a good practice exercise for junior data analysts.
- Furthermore, the insights obtained by analyzing this data are very insightful. For example, it was discovered that lower-income countries do not necessarily receive the lowest or cheapest price for Apple products. Instead, although lower-income countries have the lowest price, it is extremely close to the prices in high-income countries.

## Overview
This project analyzes the price of Apple products across 26 countries, downloaded from Kaggle and scraped from Apple's gifts page as of January 2nd, 2022. The analysis focuses on the average price paid by customers in each country, the average price in each region, and the correlation between the World Bank income group and the product prices.


## Questions
The analysis seeks to answer the following questions:

1) What is the average price paid by customers for Apple products within the 26 countries?
2) What is the average price of Apple products in each region?
3) What is the correlation between the World Bank income group and the product prices?

## Summary
The analysis revealed that Brazil has the highest average price of Apple products at $882, while Thailand and the United States have the lowest at $417 and $420, respectively. It's noteworthy that almost all products are priced higher in Upper Middle Income countries compared to High Income countries. The Airpods Max and Airpods (3rd generation) are particularly expensive in Lower Middle Income countries. Two graphs, "Apple Products Average Across Income Groups" and "Regional Average Price of Apple Products," support these findings.
